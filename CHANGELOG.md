# Changelog

All notable changes to clux are documented here.

## [3.0.3] — Unreleased

### Added

- `/clux:validate` now reports audio playback readiness: detected player (`afplay`/`paplay`/`pw-play`/`aplay`/`play`/`ffplay`) and, for each sound-enabled notification type, whether the effective sound file exists — surfacing the silent-no-op path introduced in 3.0.2 so users can tell *why* a sound isn't playing

## [3.0.2]

### Fixed

- Cross-platform sound handling: `notify-sound.sh` now detects available players (`afplay` on macOS; `paplay`/`pw-play`/`aplay`/`play`/`ffplay` on Linux) and silently no-ops when none is installed or the configured sound file is missing, instead of flashing `clux: sound file not found: …` over the tmux status bar
- Default sound notifications to `off` on systems with no usable audio player so fresh Linux installs without PulseAudio don't attempt playback
- Provide Linux-appropriate default sound files (freedesktop stereo theme) instead of hardcoded `/System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff` paths

## [3.0.1]

### Added

- `truncate-title.sh` helper for word-aware truncation of window names in status-format strings. Usage: `#(~/.config/clux/scripts/truncate-title.sh 25 "#{window_name}")` — keeps whole words rather than cutting mid-word

## [3.0.0]

### Breaking Changes

- **Remove OpenAI verb-classifier hook** (`rename-window.sh`). Window naming is now handled natively by tmux via `automatic-rename-format '#{pane_title}'`, which picks up Claude Code's OSC-set terminal title. No API key or external service required.
- Remove `CLUX_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CLUX_OPENAI_MODEL`, `CLUX_OPENAI_TIMEOUT` environment variables
- Remove `@claude-notify-smart-title` tmux option
- Remove `NOTIFY_SMART_TITLE` config variable from `helpers.sh`

### Added

- `configure-tmux.sh` now injects `automatic-rename` + `automatic-rename-format '#{pane_title}'` settings

### Migration

If upgrading from 2.x: remove `CLUX_OPENAI_API_KEY` from your environment and any `@claude-notify-smart-title` settings from tmux.conf. Window names will automatically track Claude Code's task descriptions.
